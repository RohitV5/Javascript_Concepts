var a;

// a = undefined //==> this work but dont use it like this.

// undefined means it exist in memory but no value is assigned to it, not defined means it doesnt exist at all.
// never set a avariable as undefined as it is a bad practice
if (a === undefined) {
    console.log('a is undefined');
}
